# StackOverflow Searcher Chrome

This is one of my random lets-builds. While sitting bored I decided to give Chrome Extension creation a try. In doing so I wanted to make something I'd actually use and considering the amount of time developers (myself included) spend on StackOverflow, I thought I'd make a simple search tool.

## Installation
The chrome extension is available [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stackoverflow-searcher/dbamfhkdjijljaeofmdggnhocapainba?fbclid=IwAR3jYwfe1OI9LVrFTdGSeYIGBXofbbLXO8td6b2G4ktyDZAY87Ef4LcV8lk&h=AT0q-W41KEIGyThQ0If9xTjadFE6GmbgVg0cT5YVqRsVsDqy0EDYrQ-z2wjif2ARVDjCEEIysPSVRhV5mt7VXnip28nwOK3WTklSe_tWfS1c-feagRJP_AZ8e3poW-JVDzEAnw) on the chrome web store.

## Tutorial
I am in the process of documenting how I built this plugin on my personal blog (I'll update this once I've done it) however you can find my personal site at https://jaejames.dev/.

## Bugs, Problems & Ideas
Any bugs, problems and ideas can go through the issues built into GitHub :)
